# Contributing towards Scaffold

We're thrilled you want to give us a hand at making Scaffold better! Here are a few things which should help you get started quickly.

## Reporting Bugs

The GitHub Issue tracker is the best place to submit bugs, but first we please ask that you:

* Search for an existing issue. It may be that the issue has been identified or resolved already, search both open and closed issues.
* Provide as much information as you can, this will help us to resolve bugs quickly.
* Follow the pre-defined issue template to ensure we get all the information we need.

Feel free to include screenshots, short videos, or gifs that demonstrate your problem. These will help us to recreate the issue even faster.

## Submitting Pull Requests

We're really thankful for any code or documentation changes you wish to submit to the project. To ensure your PR gets accepted quickly please ensure the following:

* Squash your history into small atomic commits.
* Follow the [seven rules of a great commit message by Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) as it applies to your commit.
* Ensure the build passes, all commites in a pull request will trigger an automated build from our CI server, this will ensure that the system is fully working. All pull requests should pass the build.

If your pull request is going to be rather large, open it as soon as possible and put "WIP" (work in progress) in the title. That way we will know not to look at it yet, but we can still help with code reviews, comments, and contributions.
